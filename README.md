# üõ†Ô∏è Data Engineering with Pandas & NumPy

This repository contains my hands-on practice for mastering **Pandas** and **NumPy** at a Data Engineer level (3+ years of experience).  
The exercises are based on real-world datasets (such as the **UK Online Retail dataset**) and cover data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and performance optimization.

## üìò Topics Covered
- **Pandas Basics**: loading, exploring, filtering, selecting data
- **Data Cleaning**: handling missing values, type conversion, feature engineering
- **Transformations**: apply functions, string processing, creating new columns
- **Aggregations & Joins**: groupby, merge, concat, pivot tables
- **Time Series**: resampling, hourly/daily trends, rolling windows
- **Performance**: chunking large files, using categoricals, vectorization
- **NumPy Basics**: arrays, broadcasting, math, conditional selection
- **NumPy + Pandas**: vectorized operations, conditional flags, normalization

## üìä Dataset
The practice is based on the **UK Online Retail dataset** (2010‚Äì2011).  
Each file (`retail-data/by-day/2010-12-01.csv`) contains transactional data with:
- `InvoiceNo`: Invoice number
- `StockCode`: Product code
- `Description`: Product description
- `Quantity`: Quantity of each item
- `InvoiceDate`: Date and time of the transaction
- `UnitPrice`: Price per unit
- `CustomerID`: Customer identifier
- `Country`: Customer‚Äôs country
